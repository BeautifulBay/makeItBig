I am learning English, so I watched a lot of American dramas. There are plenty of beautiful sentences I want to write down
and remember. That's why I wrote this script.
This is a simpile script to parse .ass/srt subtitle to txt using Python 2.7.6 
There are also two examples that you can use to try this script if it can work or not.
I hope it can help you who like English movies. Good luck!
