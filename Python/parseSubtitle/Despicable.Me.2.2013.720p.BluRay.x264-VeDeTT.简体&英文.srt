我咒你晚上睡不着觉
You know what? I hope you can't sleep at night,

you crusher of little girls' dreams!

31
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,300
仙女什么时候来
Oh, oh, when's the Fairy Princess coming?

32
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,560

我住在糖果屋里
my house is made of candy!

49
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,050
烦心的时候我就会吃糖果逃避现实
And sometimes, I eat instead of facing my problems!

50
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,200
仙女怎么会...
How come you have...

51

Hello, Jillian!

59
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,660
我知道这样说有点唐突
So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

60
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,760
我朋友娜塔莉最近恢复了单身...
but my friend Natalie, is recently single, and...

61
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,360
不不不  连门都没有

62
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,370
没门
No limb.

63
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,330
拜托  她很会玩的
Come on! She's a riot!

64

爱唱卡拉OK  有大把时间
She sings karaoke, she has a lot of free time,

65
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,710
对长相的要求也不高
looks aren't that important to her!

66
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,080
吉尔  这不可能
Look, Jill, it's not happening.

67
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,470
说真的  我自己很好
Seriously, I'm fine.

68
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,990
好吧  不说娜塔莉了
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.

69
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,990
我表妹琳达怎样
How about my cousin Linda?

70
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,860
不
No.

71
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,020
我知道有个女的刚死了老公...
Oh, I know someone whose husband just died...

72
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,080
抱歉  没看到你在那里
I'm sorry, I did not see you there.

73
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,730
还是没看到
Or there.

74
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,420
物种  未知

75
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,140
凯尔  凯尔
Kyle, Kyle,

76
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,180
凯尔  别尿在我的牵牛花上
Kyle, stop! Stop doing your business on the Petunias!

77
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,830

78
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,310

There you go, go to Fred's. Go crazy.

79

好伙计
Good boy.

80

格鲁先生
Mr. Gru?

81
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,150
什么  我没有...什么事
What, I didn't, what.. Yes?

82
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,000
我是反恶人联盟的特工露西・瓦尔德
Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.

83
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,960
抱歉
Sorry.

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,680
你得跟我走一趟
You're gonna have to come with me.

85
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,730
抱歉  我...冰冻射线
Oh, sorry, I'm... Freeze Ray!

86
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,980
正确的方式是先开枪再喊
You really should announce your weapons after you fire them,

87
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,860
格鲁先生
Mr. Gru.

88
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,440
做个示范
For example.

89
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,790
红唇电击
Lipstick taser!

90
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,380
效果真好
Oh, it works so good.

91
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:15,350
车子呢
Where is it?

92
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,560
真抱歉
Oh, Sorry.

93
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,970
给我进去  大块头
Get, in, there, you, big, man!

94
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,160
该死的
Whoa, curses.

95
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,300
跟针扎一样
Pins and needles.

96
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,460
下午好  格鲁先生
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

97

抱歉用这种方法把你请来
I apologize for our methods in getting you here.

99
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,550
我倒不觉得
I don't!

100
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,370
我可以马上再来一次  不骗你
I'd do it again in a heartbeat! I am not gonna lie,

101
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,350
我很享受抓捕他的每一刻
I enjoyed that. Every second of it,

102
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,820
感觉真是爽...
Gave me bit of a buzz, actually...

103
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,980
够了  瓦尔德特工
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

104
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,600
抱歉
Sorry.

105
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,120
好了  太过分了
Okay, this is bogus!

106
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,940
我不管你们以为自己是谁  但是...
I don't know who you think you people are, but...

107
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,590
我们是反恶人联盟
We are the Anti-Villain League.

108
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,340
是一个致力于
An ultra secret organization

109
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,110
对抗全球规模恶势力的绝密组织
dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale.

110
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,670
抢劫银行  我们懒得管
Rob a bank, we're not interested.

111
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,380
杀人放火  还是懒得管
Kill someone, not our deal.

112
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,200
但要是你想融化极地冰盖
But you were to melt the polar ice caps,

113
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,180
或是蒸发富士山
or vaporize Mount Fuji,

114
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,280
甚至是
or even,

115
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,900
偷月亮
Steal the moon.

116
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,360
那就关我们事了
Then, we notice.

117
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,250
首先  你没有证据证明是我做的
First of all, you got no proof that I did that.

118
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,170
其次  偷了之后我又放回去了
Second, after I did do that, I put it back.

119
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,860
这我们都知道  格鲁先生
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.

120
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,940
所以才请你来
That's why we brought you here.

121
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,160
我是联盟的主席  赛拉斯・兰皮谷
I am the league director, Silas Ramsbottom.

122
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:40,790
屁股
Bottom.

123
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,160
真好笑
Hilarious.

124
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,820
瓦尔德特工
Agent Wilde.

125
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,340
轮到我了?
Oh, me now?

126
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,590
最近有个绝密的实验室
Recently, an entire top secret lab disappeared

127
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,780
在北极圈消失了
from the Arctic Circle.

128
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,970
没错  整个实验室  就这样
Yeah. The entire lab, just...

129
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,570
消失了  它去哪了
Gone. Where did it go?

130
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,970
没兴趣知道
I don't care.

131
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,080
实验室正在研究PX-41
The lab was devoted to experiments involving PX-41.

132
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,880
是一种变种血清
A transmutation serum.

133
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,070
你问我什么是PX-41
What is PX-41, you ask?

134
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,650
反正很可怕
It's pretty bad.

135
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,720
看
Look.

136
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,830
一般的兔宝宝不是这样的
You usually don't see that in bunnies.

137
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,910
正如你所见
As you could see,

138
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,090
一旦落入坏人手中
In the wrong hands,

139
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,940
PX-41血清
the PX-41 serum,

140
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,890
可能成为地球上最具毁灭性的武器
could be the most devastating weapon on Earth.

141
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,320
幸运的是
Fortunately,

142
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,400
它有十分独特的化学特质
it has a very distinct chemical footprint.

143
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,610
我们利用最新的化学追踪技术
And, using the latest chem tracking technology,

144
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,880
在天堂商场发现它的踪迹
we found traces of it in the Paradise Mall.

145
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,240
商场
A Mall.

146
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
没错
Precisely.

147
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,900
我们相信
And we believe that

148
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,450
那个犯罪高手就是这群店主之一
one of these shop owners is a master criminal.

149
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,190
所以才请你来  作为一名前恶棍
And that's where you come in. As an ex-villain,

150
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,350
你肯定了解恶棍的思维和行动
you know how a villain thinks, and acts.

151
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,310
计划是安排你到商场的店铺里当卧底
The plan is, to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall,

152
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:10,510
希望你可以...
where hopefully, you'll be able to...

153
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,250
好了  我知道是怎么回事了
Okay! I see where this is going

154
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,090
狗血的动作冒险剧情
with all the "Mission: Impossible" stuff.

155
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,940
我的回答是不
But no, no.

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,490
我现在身为人父  还是个守法的商人
I'm a father now. And, a legitimate businessman.

157
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,710
我在生产一系列美味的果酱和果冻
I am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.

158
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,730
果酱跟果冻啊
"Jams and jellies".

159
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,870
什么态度
Oh, attitude!

160
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,910
就是这样
That's right!

161
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,100
谢谢  老子不干
So thanks, but no thanks.

162
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,690
给你个建议  与其把别人绑来言语相激
And here's a tip: instead of teasing people, and kidnapping them,

163
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,630
不如直接给他们打电话
maybe you should just give them a call!

164
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,680
再见  屁股先生
Good day, Mr. Sheepbutt!

165
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,000
是兰皮谷
Ramsbottom.

166
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,160
是吗  还是屁股好听些
Oh, yeah, like I said it better!

167
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:03,380
也许我不该这样说
Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this, but...

168
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,330
不过你当恶棍真是棒极了
Your work as a villain, was kind of, amazing.

169
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,210
要是你回心转意想大干一场的话
So if you ever wanna get back to doing something awesome.

170
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,510
给我们打电话
Give us a call.

171
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,880
我不是叫你们去睡觉了吗
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed!

172
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,130
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

173
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,750
你什么时候去约会
So, when are you going on your date?

174
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,440
什么
What?

175
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,160
记得吗  吉莉安小姐说给你安排了约会
Remember? Ms. Jillian said she was arranging a date for you.

176
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,510
她是个疯子  我不会去约会的
Yeah, well, she is a nutjob and I'm not going on any date.

177
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,320
为什么
Why not?

178
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,780
难道你害怕
Are you scared?

179
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,670
你们看电视播的登月报道了吗
Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV?

180
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,780
你能相信吗  简直酷毙了
Can you believe it? It's so cool!

181
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,980
-知道吗  -打扰一下  丽萨 
- You know what? - Excuse me, Lisa?

182
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,980
-前几天我跟外星人讲话了  -不会吧
- I talked to alien the other day. - no way.

183
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,280
他超可爱
He's so cute.

184
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,340
丽萨  我在想...
Hey, Lisa, I was wondering...

185
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:13,240
格鲁摸了丽萨
Gru touched Lisa!

186
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,340
丽萨得了"格鲁病"
Lisa's got Gruties!

187
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,800
害怕  怕什么
Scared? Of what?

188
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,070
女人  怎么会
Women? No!

189
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,180
胡说八道
That's bonkers!

190
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,400
我只是对约会不感兴趣而已  就这样
I just, I've no interest in going on a date, that's all!

191
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,300
结案陈词
Case closed!

192
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,360
我不害怕
I'm not scared!

193
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,210
女人
Of women.

194
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,620
也不怕约会
Or dates.

195
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
睡觉吧
Let's go to bed.

196
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,040
晚安  伊迪丝
Goodnight, Edith.

197
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,520
晚安  玛格
Goodnight, Margo.

198
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,640
慢着
hold the horses,

199
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,830
你给谁发短信呢
who are you texting?

200
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,590
没有谁  是我朋友艾弗里
No one! Just my friend Avery.

201
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,320
艾弗里  艾弗里吗
Avery. Eh? Avery?

202
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,660
女生还是男生
Is that a girl's name or a boy's name?

203
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,380
这重要吗
Does it matter?

204
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,250
不  这不重要
No! No, it doesn't matter,

205
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,910
除非是个男生
unless it's a boy!

206
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,020
我知道为什么你是男生
I know what makes you a boy.

207
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,450
你知道
Uhh, you do?

208
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,730
因为你是光头
Your bald head.

209
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
是啊
Oh. Yes.

210
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
它好光滑
It's really smooth.

211
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,730
有时候我盯着它
Sometimes I stare at it,

212
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:14,540
就在想会不会有小鸡蹦出来
and imagine a little chick popping out.

213
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,760
晚安  艾格妮丝
Goodnight, Agnes.

214
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,010
永远别长大
Never get older.

215
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,400
蒂姆  发型不错
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

216
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,750
汤米  再坚持一下  伙计
Tommy, hang in there, baby!

217
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,210
快到周五了
It's almost Friday!

218
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
今天这批果冻如何  尼法里奥博士
So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?

219
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,990
我研发了新的配方
I developed a new formula which allowed me

220
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,230
能把各种浆果调成一个味
to get every known kind of berry in a one flavor of jelly.

221
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,390
好吃
That is good!

222
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,230
我喜欢这个味...
Love the flavor of...

223
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,240
很难吃吧
It's horrible, isn't it?

224
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
怎么会
No, no!

225
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,420
我们已经有很大进展了
Oh, we're making great progress!

226
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,890
来  尝尝
Here, try some.

227
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,640
即使没人喜欢
Just because everybody hates it,

228
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,550
也不代表它不好
doesn't mean it's not good!

229
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,380
听我说  格鲁
Listen, Gru. There's something

230
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,340
有件事我一直想跟你说
I've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.

231
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,640
怎么了
What, what's wrong?

232
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,380
我怀念当恶棍的日子
I miss being evil.

233
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,240
图谋不轨  大肆犯罪
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes,

234
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,720
这才是我活着的意义
It's what I live for!

235
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,520
你不觉得我们的前途不应该仅仅是果冻吗
I mean, don't you think there's more for our future than jelly?

236
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,830
我在考虑加一条果酱生产线
Well, I'm also considering a line of jams.

237
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,920
格鲁  我已经另谋出路了
The thing is, Gru, I've now been recruited elsewhere.

238
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,500
尼法里奥博士
Dr. Nefario!

239
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,480
别闹了
Oh, come on.

240
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
你在跟我开玩笑吧
You're kidding, right?

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,280
跳进了一座活火山的喷出口
into the mouth, of an active volcano!

388
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,780
场面相当壮观
It was glorious!

389
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,760
按你的说法  猛爷不是已经死了吗
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead?

390
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,900
没人找到他的尸体
They never found the body.

391
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,930
没人找到
Oh, no.

392
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:30,120
能找到的只有
All that was ever retrieved,

393
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,330
一坨
was a pile,

394
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,130
烧焦的胸毛
of singed chest hair.

395
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,730
那张脸
That face!

396
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,310
他一定是猛爷
It has got to be El Macho.

397
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,570
我们俩夜闯他的餐厅怎么样
So what do you say, you and I break into his restaurant.

398
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,270
今晚就去
Tonight.

399
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,720
好主意
Yes, that's good.

400
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,260
我告诉你
Because I'm telling you,

401
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,320
如果PX-41血清真的在这里
if anybody in this place has the PX-41 serum,

402
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,570
那就一定在他手上
it's him!

403
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,900
好了  好了  作业做完了
Alright, alright, homework done,

404
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,070
睡衣穿上了  牙也刷了  该睡觉了
pyjamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

405
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,290
怎么那么急
What's the big hurry?

406
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,120
我有很多工作要做
I just, I have a lot of work to do.

407
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,070
工作?
Work?

408
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:02,070
什么样的工作
What kind of work?

409
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,880
很重要的生意
Very important business.

410
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,680
抱抱  亲亲
So hugs, kisses.

411
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,080
晚安  做个好梦  别让臭虫
Good night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs...

412
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,400
吧啦吧啦吧啦
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

413
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,210
但你说过要帮我
But you said you'd help me

414
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,900
练习母亲节那天的表演
practice my part for the mother's day show.

415
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,570
好吧  好吧
Fine, fine.

416
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:18,300
我来听听看  抓紧时间
Let me hear it, quickly.

417
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,320
她亲吻我的伤口
"She kisses my boo-boos.

418
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,250
她为我束起发辫
She braids my hair.

419
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,290
我的妈妈无人能比
My mother is beyond compare.

420
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,900
我们爱你  亲爱的妈妈
We love you, mothers everywhere."

421
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,780
真是  让人眼前一亮
Wow, that was, something else!

422
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,840
我很喜欢你最后的那个微笑
I really like the way you smiled at the end.

423
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,760
我们再来一次  
Let's try this one more time

424
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,970
稍微别那么像僵尸
but a tinsy-bit less like a zombie.

425
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,000
好吗
Okay?

426
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,220
好的
Okay.

427
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,770
她亲吻我的伤口
"She kisses my boo-boos.

428
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,270
她为我束起发辫
She braids my hair..."

429
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,900
完美  我该走了
Perfect! Time to go.

430
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:50,430
我觉得我不该去表演
I don't think I should do this.

431
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,350
什么意思
Wha.... what do you mean?

432
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,210
为什么不去
Why not?

433
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,940
我根本就没有妈妈
I don't even have a mom.

434
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,640
不一定要有妈妈
Well, you don't need one

435
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,730
才能表演
to do the show.

436
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,590
我的意思是
I mean,

437
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,510
你参加了退伍军人节的游行
you did the Veterans Day pageant.

438
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,560
但你并没上过战场
You haven't been in combat.

439
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,820
不一样的
This is different.

440
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:10,740
好吧  那你可以用你的想象力
Okay, well, then, maybe you can just use your imagination.

441
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,330
你是说  我假装有个妈妈吗
You mean, I pretend I have a mom?

442
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,230
是的
Yes.

443
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,380
对吧  你能做到吧
Right? You can do that, can't you?

444
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,610
能  我一直都是这么做的
Yeah! I do that all the time.

445
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,230
谢谢你  格鲁
Thanks, Gru!

446
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,880
好了
Okay,

Please...

449

Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?

450
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,980

00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:49,350
莎莎餐厅

454
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,680
我们是潜行的忍者
We're stealth ninjas.

455
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,100
我们无声无息
We make no sound.

456
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,120
没错
Right.

457
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,080
好了  猛爷  你死定了
Alright, El Macho, you're going down.

458
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,110

你在干什么
What are you doing?

461
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,810
看看有没有激光警报器
Checking for laser beam alarm triggers.

462
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,230
这里是家餐厅
It's a restaurant!

463
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,650
你可说不准这家伙会设什么样的陷阱
You never know what kind of booby traps this guy could've set.

464
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,710
对吧
Huh? Come on.

465
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,280
这里没有陷阱
There are no booby traps.

是只鸡
Huh... it's a chicken.

468
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,970
你迷路了吗  小家伙
Are you lost, little guy?

469
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,140
你一定是迷路了
You must be lost.

470
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,550
搞笑  看门鸡
Hah! Some guard dog!

471
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,620

快把它赶走 快把它赶走 快把它赶走
Get it off of me! Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

473

我抓到了
I got it!

475
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,870
那只鸡到底怎么了
What is wrong with that chicken?

476
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,750
鸡鸡复叽叽
Hey, that Pollo is Loco.

477
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,170
不好笑吗
No?

478
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,790
好了  走吧
Okay, let's go.

479

But hey, maybe you can find something with these X-ray goggles!

483

有用吗  告诉我  告诉我
How is it working, tell me, tell me!

484
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,600
怎么了 有什么不对头吗
What's wrong? Something wrong?

485
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,760
这景象我会永生难忘
That is an image I'll never get out of my brain!

486
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,130
我就知道
I knew it!

487
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,030

我们想来看看你工作

534
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,760
露西  她们是我的女儿
Lucy, these are my girls.

535
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,960
玛格  伊迪丝和艾格妮丝
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

536
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,450
姑娘们  这是露西
Girls, Lucy.

537
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:52,800
露西  这是姑娘们
Lucy, Girls.

538
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,740
你好
Hello.

539
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:54,770
你好
Hi.

540
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:04,670
你单身吗
Are you single?

541
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,430
我的老天
Oh. Goodness.

542
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,920
对了  我有个主意
Oh, hey! I have an idea,

543
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,190
露西和我有很多事情要做
Since Lucy and I have lots of work to do,

544
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,730
你们为什么不去逛街呢
Why don't you girls go and explore the mall?

545
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,950
拿着这些钱  去买些没用的玩意吧
Here is some money, go buy some useless mall junk.

546
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,640
头绳什么的
Some headbands...

547
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,310
你会娶露西吗
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

548
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:22,170
你发疯了吗
Are you out of your gorf?

549
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,420
不会的  她只是个同事
No! She just works with me.

550
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,720
你爱上她啦
Plus you love her.

551
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,610
你爱她
You love her!

552
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,390
你爱她
You love her!

553
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,100
你真的真的很爱她
You really, really love her!

554
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,960
好了  别说了
Okay, stop.

555
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,550
胡说八道  我连喜欢她都谈不上
These are sordid lies. I don't even like her.

556
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,710
快去玩吧
Now go have fun.

557
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,670
差点忘了
Almost forgot!

558
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:40,010
祝你拯救世界好运  拜拜
Good luck saving the world! Bye!

559
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:41,140
拜拜  格鲁
Bye, Gru!

560
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,270
这就是孩子
Kids, right?

561
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,080
她们可真  好玩
They're, funny.

562
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,120
那些女孩很崇拜你
Those girls totally adore you.

563
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:52,540
我觉得你是个有趣的爸爸
I think you're a fun dad.

564
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,370
当然  我超有趣的
Huh. I'm pretty fun.

565
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,250
这是偷窃行为
That's stealing.

566
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,080
如果我的愿望是一百个免费硬币就不算了
Not if my wish was to ever get a hundred free coins.

567
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,820
雨天终究会放晴
This rainy day is temporary

568
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,950
人海中他鹤立鸡群
The contrast is why we got him

569
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,120
阳光在那乌云后
Cause sunshine due is just a cloud

570
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,480
后后后  吼吼吼
Away way way way way way

571
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,840
吼吼吼  吼吼吼
Way way way way way way

572
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,410
一时失意又怎样
So what you blown a fuse

573
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,680
人生低谷人人有
Well that happens to us all

574
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,070
风水总是轮流转
When I come with great news

575
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:41,410
卷土再重来  来来来  
The day could change. Change change change

576
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,820
眼镜真棒
Cool glasses.

577
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,280
我叫安东尼奥
I'm Antonio.

578
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,250
我叫玛格
I'm Margo.

579
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,300
我正要去吃甜点
I was just going to get a cookie.

580
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,870
想一起来吗
Care to join me?

581
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:53,520
那个  当然
Uhh... sure...

582
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:56,360
我叫玛格
I'm, Margo.

583
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,910
我过一会再来找你们
Umm... I'll catch up with you guys later.

584
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,920
拜拜
Bye!

585
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,680
我能说"好恶心"吗
Can I be the first to say, "Eww"!

586
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,250
我们必须告诉格鲁
We got to go tell Gru!

587
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:20,940
好了  我进来了
Alright, I'm going in.

588
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,740
如果有血清的迹象
If it picks up any traces of the serum,

589
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,390
你的皮带扣就会发出这样的声音
the center of your belt buckle will make a sound like this.

590
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,810
好了  我听到了  听到了
Okay. I get it. I get it.

591
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,560
欢迎
Welcome,

592
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,910
来到秃鹰美发俱乐部
to "Eagle Hair Club".

593
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,030
你也是时候来了
It's about time you showed up.

594
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,190
格鲁先生
Mr. Gru.

595
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,220
你知道我的名字吗
You know my name?

596
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,250
每当头顶缺毛的人走进商场时
When someone moves into the mall who is follically challenged,

597
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:55,630
我就有责任去了解他们
I make it my business to know all about them.

598
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,040
你都秃了  真是可怜
You're bald. And that is bad.

599
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,240
好好呆着  小宝贝
Here you go, my sweet.

600
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,190
我还没有任何发现
I'm getting nothing so far.

601
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,850
看来你得到处找找
I think you need to look around.

602
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,100
咦  这个挺有趣
Wow, this looks interesting.

603
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,360
这是什么
What is it?

604
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,020
看来你是一位艺术爱好者
I take it you're an art lover?

605
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:17,790
没有血清
No serum.

606
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,330
没那么爱好
Yeah, not so much.

607
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,200
这个迷人的小玩意又是什么
Oh, how about this impressive trinket?

608
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,670
这可不是小玩意
I hardly call it trinket,

609
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,400
-格鲁先生  国际...-没有
- Mr. Gru. International... - Nothing.

610
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,650
我没兴趣
Yeah, I don't care.

611
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,370
等等  我收到信号了
Hold on, I'm picking up something.

612
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,240
就在墙后面
Behind that wall!

613
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,340
这是些什么
Ahh... What do we have here?

614
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,760
这些是试戴的假发
These are my trial wigs.

615
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:45,490
你应该拿一顶
You should take one.

616
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:46,580
免了
No, thanks.

617
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,960
墙那边是什么
So what's on the other side of the wall?

618
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,940
你这人  看着我  集中精力
You are! Look at me! Focus!

619
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:51,640
格鲁
Gru?

620
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,770
我保证  这假发会彻底改变你
I promise, that this wig will transform you,

621
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,030
告别丑陋  重塑魅力
from ugly, to irresistible.

622
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,500
玛格交男朋友啦
Margo has a boyfriend!

623
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,440
他们还去约会了
And they're going on a date!

624
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,940
约会  男朋友  什么
Date?! Boyfriend?! What?!

625
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,750
她去那边了
There she goes!

626
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,340
你真是风趣
Oh, you're so funny.

627
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:34,960
恶心
Gross!

628
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,450
看看  他们相爱了
Look, they're in love!

629
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:39,190
不不不  别那么说  他们可没有
Oh, no, no. Do not say that they're---no, no, no!

630
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,700
我的梦想是  有一天  能以玩游戏为生
And my dream, is to one day, play video games for a living.

631
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:47,360
你真是有思想
You're so complicated.

632
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,410
玛格
Margo.

633
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,580
这什么情况
What is going on here?

634
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,060
喔  格鲁
Oh, Gru.

635
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,750
这位是  安东尼奥

636
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,490
而我是  玛格
Mellamo, Margo.

637
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,170
你拍一我拍一
Mellamo Lama Ding Dong.

638
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:58,870
我管你是谁
Who cares.

639
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,680
我们走
Let's go.

640
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,370
周二免费
Get it free on Tuesdays.

641
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,350
爸爸
Papa!

642
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,810
见到你太高兴了  老朋友
So good to see you again, mi compadre!

643
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,240
原来你已经认识我爸爸了
Oh.. I see you have already met my father.

644
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:55,640
搞什么  爸爸
What the... father?

645
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,240
是啊  世界太疯狂
Si! Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh?

646
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,550
来坐下  让我招待你
Come, sit! Let me get you something.

647
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,850
看看你
Oh, look at you!

648
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,610
他喜欢我
He likes me!

649
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,010
对不起  宝利特通常都
Oh... I'm sorry. Paulito is usually,

650
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,200
很友好的
very friendly.

651
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:14,870
他昨晚受惊了
He had a rough night.

652
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,680
那个  我们真的要走了
Well, we really should be going.

653
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,680
姑娘们  走吧
Girls, come on.

654
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,880
真可惜
That is a pity.

655
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,270
年轻的爱情  多美好啊  是吧
Young love, is beautiful, no?

656
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:26,880
不要
No!

657
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:30,960
他们才没相爱  他们压根不怎么认识
They are not in love. They hardly know each other.

658
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,830
你说的对  大哥
You are right, cabeza del nuevo.

659
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:36,540
他们必须好好了解下对方
They must get to know each other better.

660
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:37,770
安东尼奥
Antonio,

661
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,890
你为何不邀请你的女友及其家人
Why don't you invite your girlfriend? And her family.

662
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:42,620
参加我们的五月五派对呢
To our Cinco De Mayo party.

663
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,560
不  不
No, no...

664
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:44,620
去
Sì!

665
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,780
对不起  你是说猛爷
I'm sorry, El Macho?

666
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,420
莎莎酱乌龙事件后他不是解除嫌疑了吗
Haven't we eliminated him as a suspect after the whole "Salsa" Incident?

667
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,760
是的  不过有新情况
Yes, but there has been a new development,

668
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,740
我告诉你  就是他
and I'm telling you, this is the guy.

669
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,330
你必须立刻拘捕他
You need to arrest him immediately.

670
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:15,070
还有
And!

671
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,710
他那帅到爆的儿子
His deviously charming son.

672
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,590
我确定他儿子也有份
I'm pretty sure that the son is involved too.

673
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:22,050
肯定有份
The son, also!

674
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,380
你必须抓住他儿子
You got to get the son!

675
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,030
我认为他儿子才是主谋
I think that the son is the mastermind.

676
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:28,690
他那种神情
There's a look,

677
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,830
眼中透着邪恶  我恨死了
there's a devilish look in his eyes, and I don't like it!

678
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,970
好吧  但是我没有看到任何证据
Yes, but I don't believe seeing any evidence...

679
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:36,990
证据个屁 我相信直觉 直觉告诉了我  
Evidence, schmevidence, I go with my gut, and my gut tells me,

680
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,640
你们要找的人就是猛爷
that this guy is El Macho.

681
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,310
把他关起来
Lock him up,

682
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:41,980
还有他儿子
lock up the son,

683
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,750
别忘了他儿子
don't forget about the son!

684
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,140
那孩子  让我不寒而栗
The kid, gives me the creeps!

685
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,720
天哪  天哪  天哪
Oh, dear, oh dear, oh dear...

686
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:52,990
事情也有好的一面
But, on the less crazy side of things,

687
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:56,830
格鲁在秃鹰美发会所找到了血清的踪迹
Gru discovered traces of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!

688

Hmm. Interesting.

689
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,910
你知道是谁办到的吗
Yeah! And you know who made that happen?

690
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,590
是他  搞定了
This guy. Nailed it.

691

厉害吧
Amazing, right?

692
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,590
不  我是说
No, I mean...

693
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:07,120
当然  但犯人不是他
Sure, but it's not him!

694
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,520
是猛爷
It is El Macho...

格鲁  拜托
Gru, come on.

699
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,560
他真的以为是猛爷
He really thinks it's El Macho.

700
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:23,700
你看出来了吗
Can you tell him?

701
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,650
夏日姗姗  天气炎炎
In the summer time when the weather is high

702
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,670
蓝蓝天空  触手可及
You can stretch right up and touch the sky

703
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:49,970
当天气静好
When the weather's fine,

开心又快乐
We're always happy

706

享受生活  才是人生真谛

凯文到底哪去了
Where the heck is Kevin?

715
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,690
好吧  我们得回顾一下
Alright, we need to revisit

716
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:49,950
你们的休假时间了
the number of vacation days you guys get.

717
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:51,820
都到哪里撒欢去了
I can't find anybody anymore!

718
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,260
格鲁  我是吉莉安

I was thinking you two could get some grub.

722
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,870
开怀畅饮
You know, tear it up,

723
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:04,910

格鲁不在家
Gru's not here!

728
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,910
真的吗
Are you sure?

729
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,440
当然  他刚说的
Yes, he just told me!

730
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,160
我是说  不  他没说
I mean no, he didn't just tell me.

731
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:25,250
艾格妮丝  格鲁在哪
Agnes, where is Gru?

732
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,400
他在  抹口红
He's, putting on lipstick.

733
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:31,630
他在  打苍蝇

734
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,570
他在  割脑袋
He's, chopping a head off!

735

736
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,610
我知道你在家  格鲁
I know you're in there, Gru.

737
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,970
这次你逃不掉了
There's no way you're getting out of this.

738
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,780
不得不说我一开始很紧张
I have to tell you I was so nervous about tonight.

739
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:56,280
这年头那么多骗子
I mean there's just so many phonies out there.

740
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,200
是啊  我懂
Yes, I hear you.

741

显然没有
I mean, obviously you don't.

744

你会考虑去健身吗
But would you consider it?

745
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,210
身材对珊侬来说可是非常重要
Physical fitness is very important to Shannon.

754

非常感谢
Ah..Well, thank you very much.

755
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,900
-我原来  -我有个认识的人能帮到你
- I was...- I know someone who can fix that for you.

756
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:47,360
你很快就能改掉口音了
And you'll be talking normal in no time!

757
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,760
这里好热啊
Whew... Is it hot in here?

758

761
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,570

不是
Ah, I don't think so.

763

我就知道
I knew it.

764
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:06,430
你是个骗子
You're a phony.

765
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:07,580
我痛恨骗子
I hate phonies.

766
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,840

No, they're not!

768
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,260
你知道我要做什么吗
You know what I'm gonna do?

769
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:14,350
我要把它  从你的脑袋上扯下来
I'm gonna rip that thing off your head

770

让大家都知道
and show everyone

771
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:17,370
你是个秃头大骗子
what a bald-headed phony you are.

772
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,730
你休想  这位小姐
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

773
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,260
喂
Hello?

774
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,160

00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,600
最近怎么样
How are you doing?

779
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,410
看来你的约会对象醉倒了
Wow, looks like your date's out for the count.

780
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:40,730
就像有人给她打了一针镇定剂似的
It's like she's been shot with a mild tranquilizer.

781
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,520
不要
Noooo...

782
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,490
眨眼睛意思是  我真的给她打了镇定剂
Yeah, I'm winking 'cause that's what actually happened.

783
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:51,720
打扰了  发生了什么
Excusi, what's happening here?

784
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:52,750
她不喜欢吗
She no like?

785
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,480
她只是
Oh, she's just, uhh...

786
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,200
知道了  知道了
Oh.. Oh-ho-ho.. Sì! Sì.

787
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,550
我们送她回家吧
Shall we take her home?

788
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,900
你刚刚的约会
Well, I think you did it.

789
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:46,830
堪称史上最糟约会
You just officially had the worst date ever.

790
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:48,650
可不是吗
Ohh. Tell me about it.

791
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:49,800
别担心
Don't worry.

792
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,940
以后总不至于比这更糟  对吧
It can only get better from here, right?

793
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,200
如果真的更糟  我的飞镖枪借你
But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun.

794
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,570
我有几次就派上用场了
I do use it on, one or two dates myself.

795
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,120
和约会比起来
Yeah, you know as far as dates go,

796
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,210
我觉得独自一人更好
I think I'm good with just, the one.

797
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,080
晚安  搭档
Good night, partner.

798
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,730
今晚很好玩
This was fun.

799
00:56:12,030 --> 00:56:14,450
是啊  的确是
Yes, surprisingly, it was.

800
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,730
私下告诉你
Oh, and just between you and me,

801
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,840
我觉得你光头更好看
You look much better bald.

802
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:23,610
明天见
See you tomorrow!

803
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,090
说起来很疯狂
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say

804
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,290
阳光明媚  一身轻松
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break

805
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,080
我像个要升空的热气球
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space

806
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,260
这么说  约会很顺利吧
So, I take it the date went well?

807
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,840
不  糟糕透了
No, it was horrible.

808
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:48,090
什么都无所谓
Like I don't care baby by the way

809
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,660
因为我很快乐
Because I'm happy

810
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:56,040
如果你也无忧无虑  就一起拍拍手
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

811
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,580
因为我很快乐
Because I'm happy

812
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,970
如果你也快乐至上  就一起拍拍手
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth

813
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:03,530
因为我很快乐
Because I'm happy

814
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:07,810
如果你懂快乐的重要性  就一起拍拍手
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you

815
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:09,540
因为我很快乐
Because I'm happy

816
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,770
如果你正想拍手  就一起拍拍手
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

817
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:18,370
什么也不能令我沮丧
Bring me down, can't nothing

818
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:21,460
谁也不可能让我悲伤
Bring me Down, my level is too high

819
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,120
什么也不能令我沮丧
Bring me down, can't nothing

820
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,120
我从不悲伤
Bring me down, I said

821
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,400
因为我很快乐
Because I'm happy

822
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,650
如果你也无忧无虑  就一起拍拍手
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof

823
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,320
因为我很快乐
Because I'm happy

824
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:37,750
如果你也怀揣梦想  就一起拍拍手
Clap along if you know what's best what you wanna do

825
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:44,850
兰皮谷先生
Mr. Ramsbottom?

826
00:57:45,210 --> 00:57:46,020
你好
Oh, hello.

827
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:47,760
你怎么在这里
What are you doing here?

828
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,840
我们抓到他了
We got him.

829
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:49,880
抓到谁了
Got who?

830
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:51,510
弗洛伊德・秃鹰君
Floyd Eagle-san.

831
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,840
特工昨晚找到了他店里的密室
Our agents located a secret room in his shop last night,

832
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,400
并且
and, uh,

833
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,370
发现了这个

834
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,510
已经空了  但还有少量PX-41血清残留
It's empty but we found traces of the PX-41 serum in it.

835
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:01,970
就是他了
He is our man.

836
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,500
虽然没指望上你  但我们还是搞定了
So, somehow, in spite of your incompetence, we solved this one.

837
00:58:07,310 --> 00:58:08,460
我是被陷害的
I was framed!

838
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,410
这次你逃不掉的
You won't get away with this!

839
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:11,810
把你们的脏手拿开
Get your mitts off of me!

840
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,650
好吧
Alright, so...

841
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:16,700
现在怎么办
What now?

842
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,080
你可以回去忙你的生意了
Well, now, you're free to go back to your business.

843
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,540
果酱和果冻
Hmmm! Jams and jellies.

844
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,480
而瓦尔德特工
And it looks like Agent Wilde

845
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,880
会被调到澳大利亚分部

846
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,770
澳大利亚
Australia?

847
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:29,790
是的
Yes.

848
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:31,770
感谢你所做的一切
But thank you, for everything.

849
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:34,250
虽然你什么也没做
And by everything, of course I mean, nothing.

850
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:37,010
自己保重吧  格鲁先生
Toodles and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

851
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,730
你好

852
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:43,690
你好
Hey.

853
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,460
我们抓到他了
So, we got him.

854
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,880
太好了
Yay!

855
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,960
棒极了
That's great.

856
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,430
你要去澳大利亚了吗
And now you're going to Australia?

857
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,150
还没最终确定下来
Well, it's not definite yet.

858
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:53,290
我还在考虑
I'm still figuring it out.

859
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,270
已经开始练习口音了
Already been working on my accent.

860
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,890
模仿澳大利亚口音

861
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,400
休・杰克曼
Hugh Jackman

862
00:58:58,170 --> 00:58:59,400
澳大利亚著名男演员

863
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,460
很兴奋
Pretty excited.

864
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,440
很棒
Great.

865
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,200
祝你好运
Well, good luck.

866
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,460
谢谢
Thanks.

867
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:11,500

868
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,740
给  我想把这个送给你
Oh, here. I wanted to give you this.

869
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,700
你的口红枪
Your lipstick taser?

870
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,620
是的  算是个留念吧
Yeah, it's just a memento.

871
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:21,500
就是  你知道的
Just... you know.

872
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,510

873
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,180
谢谢你  露西
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

874
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,200
瓦尔德特工
Agent Wilde?

875
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:31,080
他们在叫你了
Well, it looks like they need you.

876
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:32,270
那你
So...

877
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:32,990

Yeah...

878

我得走了
I better go.

879
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:36,940
再见  格鲁
Bye, Gru.

880
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,410
我给你带了把伞
I brought you an umbrella.

881
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:20,940
谢谢你
Ah, thank you.

882
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:22,150
你在外面做什么
What are you doing out here?

883
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:26,880
记得你说过我喜欢露西吗
Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?

884
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,580
其实
Well, it turns out...

885
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:32,110
你说得对
You are right.

886
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:33,950
真的吗
Really?

887
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:35,730
真的  但是
Yes, but...

888
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:37,710
她就要搬走了
Well, she's moving away.

889
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:40,590
我再也见不到她了
I'm never going to see her again.

890
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,430
我能帮得上忙吗
Is there anything I can do to help?

891
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:49,200
不
I don't...

892
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,530
不能  亲爱的
I don't think so, sweetheart.

893
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,580
那你自己能做点什么吗
Well is there anything you could do?

894
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,000
你好  露西  我是格鲁
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

895
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:00,400
我知道
I know...

896
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,740
到目前为止
Up to this point,

897
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,500
我们的关系仅限于工作
our relationship has been strictly professional.

898
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,070
而且你就要前往澳大利亚
And you're leaving for Australia and all...

899
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:09,070
但是
But...

900
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:12,250
我想问你
Okay, here is the question.

901
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:14,440
你愿不愿意
Would you like to

902
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,950
和我出去约会
to go out on a date

903
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,230
才怪
Ayyy... No.

904
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,270
这样可不行
Okay, that's not helping.

905
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:25,020
来吧
Alright. Here we go.

906
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:26,390
这次来真的
For real this time.

露西・瓦尔德
电话(626) 584-5923

908
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,790

I can do this.

909
01:01:57,070 --> 01:01:57,840
我恨你
I hate you.

910
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,720
五月五
Cinco de mayo

911
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,480
五月五

912
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,020
这地方太炫了
This place is awesome!

913
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,580
好吧  我们去玩吧
Okay, let's party!

914
01:03:48,580 --> 01:03:52,050
但首先  我们重温一下规矩
But, first, let us go over the rules!

915
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,170
没有规矩哪有欢乐呢
Because, what is fun without the rules.

916
01:03:55,170 --> 01:03:57,220
艾格妮丝  别吃太多
Agnes, easy on the churros.

917
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,260
伊迪丝  不许杀人

918
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:00,740
玛格

01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,020
你好  格鲁先生
Hello, Mr. Gru.

920
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,230
好吧
Argh... okay.

921
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,190
格鲁
Gru!

922
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,410
你和男孩之间
There must be a standard 6 feet of space,

923
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:10,020
至少保持6英尺距离
between you and boys.

924
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,990
尤其是这个男孩
Especially this boy.

925
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,060
你真幽默
Ah, you are a funny man.

926
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,810
没有规矩  先生
There are no rules, se?or.

927
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,190
这可是五月五节
It's Cinco De Mayo!

928
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:20,010
来吧  尽情欢乐吧
Come on! Let's party and relax!

929
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:25,110
你怎么了
Hey, what's wrong?

930
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:27,420
没什么  什么事都没有
Oh, nothing. Nothing's wrong.

931
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:28,490
在试着冷静下来
I'm just chilling.

932
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:29,830
蘸着鳄梨酱
With the guac,

933
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:31,820
吃我的薯片帽
from my chip hat.

934
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:35,900
格鲁  拜托
Gru, please.

935
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:38,200
我太清楚这种表情了
I know that look all too well.

936
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:40,590
这是心碎的表情
It is the look of a broken heart.

937
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:42,250
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

938
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:43,890
相信我  朋友
Believe me, my friend.

939
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:46,040
我也曾在无数个夜晚中
I, too, have spent many nights

940
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:48,550
想将内心的悲伤深埋于
trying to drown my sorrows,

941
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,790
鳄梨色拉酱中
in Guacamole.

942
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,880
你吗
You?

943
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:51,960
没错
Yes.

944
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:53,740
但是
But,

945
01:05:54,110 --> 01:05:55,400
我们挺过来了
we are survivors.

946
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:58,110
我们远远不是
There is much more to us,

947
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:59,350
表面看起来那么简单
than meets the eye.

948
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,150
玩的开心点
Enjoy the party.

949
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:42,530
什么
What?

950
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,410
你想来点花生仁或小脆饼吗
Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?

951
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,300
这笑话真有意思
That's a good joke.

952
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,330
我刚刚拉了粑粑哦
I just did a boom-boom.

953
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:15,720
请您赶快做出选择
I really need you to make a choice now.

954
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:18,650
我选格鲁
I choose Gru.

955
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,080
我选格鲁
I choose Gru!

956
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,350
谢谢你  格鲁空中小姐
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

957
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:29,200
不用谢
You're welcome!

958
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,820
你还是那么厉害  我的朋友
You have not lost your touch, my friend.

959
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,600
我就知道
I knew it!

960
01:09:09,090 --> 01:09:10,610
你就是猛爷
You are El Macho.

961
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,640
没错
That's right!

962
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,630
没人相信我
Nobody believed me!

963
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:16,810
但我知道你根本没死
But I knew you weren't dead.

964
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,850
当然
Of course not.

965
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:21,100
我只是诈死
I merely faked my death.

966
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,030
但现在
But now...

967
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:24,380
该是我
It's time for me,

968
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:28,360
回归邪恶的完美时刻了
to make a spectacular return to evil.

969
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,600
博士
Doctor!

970
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,230
我觉得现在是时候
I think it's time,

971
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,640
给格鲁展示
to show Gru,

972
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,330
我们的研究成果了
what we're up to here?

973
01:09:34,330 --> 01:09:36,270
尼法里奥博士
Dr. Nefario?

974
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:38,480
很高兴见到你  格鲁
Nice to see you, Gru!

975
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:43,330
这就是你的新工作?
Whaaa... So this is your new job opportunity?

976
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:44,770
没错
Absolutely.

977
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:46,430
你一定会喜欢这个的
You're gonna like this.

978
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,670
抱歉  我借用了你的小不点们
Sorry. I had to borrow some of your minions,

979
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,630
但绝对物有所值
but it was for a worthy cause.

980
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:58,930
凯文
Oooh.. Kevin!

981
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,000
不  他已经不是凯文了
No, he is not Kevin anymore!

982
01:10:02,090 --> 01:10:02,990
现在
Now...

983
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,130
他是个坚不可摧
He is an indestructible,

984
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,100
不会思考的
mindless,

985
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:07,870
杀人机器
killing machine!

986
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,940
看着吧
Just watch this.

987
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,090
最厉害的就是
And here's the best part:

988
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,660
我有整整一支军队呢
I got an army of them!

989
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,800
不久
Soon,

990
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,100
我就会把它们
I will unleash them,

991
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,650
释放到世界各处
on the world!

992
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:48,030
如果有任何人
And if anyone,

993
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:51,010
试图阻止它们
anyone tries to stop them...

994
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,620
那座城市就会被吃掉
The city gets eaten!

995
01:10:55,170 --> 01:10:56,940
我们可以合作
We can do it together!

996
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,110
合作?
Together?

997
01:10:58,110 --> 01:10:59,410
对  合作
Together!

998
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:02,680
多年来我一直钦佩你的工作成果  朋友
I have admired your work for years, amigo.

999
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,710
盗月大计
Stealing the moon?

1000
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,280
简直太赞了
Are you kidding?

1001
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:09,300
我们定会势不可挡
We would be unstoppable.

1002
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,680
你
Men like you,

1003
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,940
加上我
men like me...

1004
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:15,820
我们能够统治世界
We, should be ruling the world!

1005
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:17,750
怎么样  加入吗
So, are you in?

1006
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,240
好啊  也许吧
Oh, yeah! Probably.

1007
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:23,560
也许?
Probably?

1008
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,360
我的意思是  当然  当然加入
I mean, yes! Yes, Of course, yes.

1009
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:29,150
只是我现在手头上有事
I just, have a lot going on right now.

1010
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:31,930
在我们占领地球之前
I just need to get some things off my plate,

1011
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:35,690
我得先把这些事解决了再说
before we start taking over the world, that's all.

1012
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:36,390
你说什么
Excuse me?

1013
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:40,860
没事  没事  我一定加入
No, no, forget it. 100%, I am in.

1014
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,990
那是什么声音  你们听见了吗
I think, what is that? Do you hear that?

1015
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:48,180
那是艾格妮丝在叫我呢
I do. That's Agnes calling me, from undis...

1016
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,850
绝对加入
Totally in!

1017
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,800
你知道吗  我不觉得他会加入我们
You know what? I am not so convinced that he is in.

1018
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:11,310
伊迪丝  艾格妮丝  过来
Edith, Agnes, come on!

1019
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:12,600
抱歉
Oops, sorry!

1020
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,740
我们得马上回家
You need to go home now!

1021
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:15,000
玛格在哪
Where is Margo?

1022
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:24,240
玛格
Margo!

1023
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,060
快  我们要...
Come on! We're...

1024
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:27,990
你这是怎么了
Hey, what's wrong?

1025
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,800
我讨厌男孩
I hate boys.

1026
01:12:33,030 --> 01:12:34,630
是啊  他们最讨厌了
Yes, they stink.

1027
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:37,360
不过亲爱的  我们得走了
Now, sorry, honey, we got to go.

1028
01:13:01,190 --> 01:13:02,280
抱歉
Sorry.

1029
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,870
宝利特
Hey, Paulito.

1030
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,030
怎么了
What's the matter?

1031
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,310
你好  爱德华多
Oh, hey, Eduardo.

1032
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,390
露西
Lucia.

1033
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:22,260
抱歉  宝利特平常不这样的
I apologize. Paulito, is usually not like this.

1034
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:25,300
有一次它也是这样对...
The same thing happened the other day with...

1035
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:26,880
对格鲁的
With Gru...

1036
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,410
说到格鲁
Speaking of Gru,

1037
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:32,160
你瞧见他了吗
have you seen him?

1038
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,500
我得和他谈谈
I really need to talk to him.

1039
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:36,730
我觉得他就在这附近
Yes, I think he's somewhere around here.

1040
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,720
你们俩很亲密吧
You two are close, no?

1041
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,570
我也不清楚
Oh... I don't know.

1042
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:44,120
我们  也没那么亲密啦
I mean, close, I wouldn't say we're, "Close".

1043
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,030
他说我们很亲密吗
Why, did he say we're close?

1044
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:45,930
他亲口说的吗
Did he say that?

1045
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,560
他倒没这么说过
It's not what he did say.

1046
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,200
比如说
For instance,

1047
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,940
他从没说过
he never mentioned...

1048
01:13:51,940 --> 01:13:55,430
你们都在反恶人联盟工作
That you were both working for the Anti-Villain League!

1049
01:13:56,290 --> 01:13:57,900
你得跟我走
You're coming with me.

1050
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,700
糟了
Funky.

1051
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:10,700
爱德华多真的就是猛爷吗
So Eduardo's actually El Macho?

1052
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,440
厉害
Cool!

1053
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,980
不  一点都不厉害
No, it is not cool!

1054
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,460
我第一眼就看穿他了
Once I pretty much knew it was him all along,

1055
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,370
所以还是我比较厉害
so if anyone's cool, it's me.

1056
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:20,590
格鲁
Gru!

1057
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,780
你好啊  尼法里奥博士
Well, Dr. Nefario.

1058
01:14:22,780 --> 01:14:23,860
猛爷盯上你了
El Macho's onto you.

1059
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:25,560
他知道你是反恶人联盟的人了
He knows you're working for the AVL.

1060
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:27,920
而且他抓了你的搭档
And, he's got your partner.

1061
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,050
露西
Lucy?

1062
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:30,960
那不可能
Well, that's, impossible.

1063
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,980
她去澳大利亚了
She's on her way to Australia.

1064
01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:33,620
尼法里奥
Nefario!

1065
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,210
抱歉  得走了
Sorry, got to go.

1066
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,800
他抓了露西?
He's got Lucy?

1067
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,270
抓不了多久的
Not for long.

1068
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:42,360
快点
Come on.

1069
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:44,060
我们要去把她救出来
We're getting her out of there.

1070
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,740
什么声音
What was that?

1071
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,010
什么都没有啊
I don't see anything.

1072
01:16:42,420 --> 01:16:43,330
我的独角兽
My unicorn!

1073
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:44,960
艾格妮丝  快跑
Agnes, run!

1074
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:20,890
过来  快
Come on! Hurry!

1075
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,090
快关上
Move!

1076
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:25,980
怎么了
What's the matter?

1077
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,240
凯文
Kevin!

1078
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,950
尼法里奥博士  你回来了
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

1079
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,550
如假包换
In the flesh!

1080
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,770
还带着
Behold...

1081
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:58,370
解药
The Antidote.

1082
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:02,110
快来
Come on.

1083
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,160
这些烂果冻终于能派上用场了
It's time we put this horrible jelly to some good use.

1084
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:22,850
你们俩给我专心点
Hey! Guys! Come on! Stay focus here!

1085
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,030
该死啊
Curses!

1086
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:07,610
又栽了
Foiled again!

1087
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:10,150
他们俩把我抓住了
These guys captured me!

1088
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,370
快上树
Up that tree.

1089
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,080
快  快
Hurry! Hurry!

1090
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:05,140
你好  格鲁
Hello, Gru!

1091
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,660
干得漂亮  尼法里奥博士
Hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

1092
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,270
解药都掺进果冻里了
I put all antidote in the jelly.

1093
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:15,560
虽然我很愿意造出邪恶军队来毁灭世界
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil army to destroy the world...

1094
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:18,500
但谁都别想对付我的家人
But nobody messes with my family.

1095
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:20,270
谢谢你  博士
Thank you, Doctor.

1096
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:22,640
现在让我们去救...
Now let's go get the...

1097
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:24,910
你好
Hi!

1098
01:21:24,990 --> 01:21:26,980
你把孩子们也带来了
You brought the girls?

1099
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,010
是啊
Yes.

1100
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,710
不行吗
Oh. Is that wrong?

1101
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:43,330
我的怪物军怎么了
What's happening... to my minions?

1102
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,660
格鲁
Gru?

1103
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:49,180
你们  去解决剩下的怪物军
You guys, take care of the rest of the minions.

1104
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,190
我去救露西
I'm going to find Lucy.

1105
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:04,950
尝尝果冻的厉害  长毛怪
Eat jelly, you furry freaks!

1106
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,260
结束了  猛爷
It's over, El Macho.

1107
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:36,930
露西在哪里
Now where is Lucy?

1108
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,560
自己看吧
Let me show you.

1109
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,940
你好  格鲁
Oh. Hey, Gru!

1110
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,640
你说对了  他果然是那个什么猛爷
Turns out you were right about the Polo Macho thing, huh?

1111
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:01,420
一按这个按钮
One push of this button,

1112
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,320
火箭就会发射
and I send that rocket,

1113
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,800
径直冲进那个我诈死的火山里
straight into the same volcano where I faked my death.

1114
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,300
只不过
Only this time...

1115
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,830
这次真的会死
It's for real.

1116
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:11,890
不
No!

1117
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:25,910
我们本可一起统治世界的  格鲁
We could have ruled the world together, Gru.

1118
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:27,600
但现在
But now...

1119
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,850
你等着受死吧
You're gonna die.

1120
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,980
口红枪
Lipstick taser!

1121
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,070
他居然学我
Aww. He copied me.

1122
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,350
我才不怕
I am not afraid,

1123
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,680
你那个果冻枪
of your jelly guns.

1124
01:24:57,690 --> 01:25:00,590
这个可不是果冻枪  亲爱的
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, Sunshine.

1125
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,400
别担心  格鲁  我没事
Don't worry about me, Gru, I'll be fine!

1126
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:19,960
比这更糟糕的我都经历过
I have survived lots worse than this.

1127
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:21,220
好吧  其实没有
Okay, that's not entirely true.

1128
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,400
我都快吓死了
Actually I'm kinda freaking out up here!

1129
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:25,780
别担心  我会救你出去的
Don't worry. I will get you out of this.

1130
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,100
我真讨厌这只鸡
I really hate that chicken.

1131
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,770
是剪红线吗  一定是红线
Is that a red one? It's definitely the red one!

1132
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:06,830
格鲁
Gru!

1133
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,580
没时间了
Any time now!

1134
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:13,020
露西  我们这次可能没命了
Lucy, we may not get out of this alive.

1135
01:26:13,020 --> 01:26:14,930
所以我得问你个问题
So, I need to ask you a question.

1136
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,930
你可得快点问
Uhh... Better make it quick!

1137
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:19,000
如果我约你出去
If I asked you out on a date,

1138
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,740
你会同意吗
What would you have said?

1139
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,280
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

1140
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,370
愿意
Yes!

1141
01:26:25,700 --> 01:26:26,790
跳
Jump!

1142
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:40,870
露西
Lucy?

1143
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:43,290
露西  你在哪
Lucy, where are you?

1144
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:48,000
露西
Ah... Lucy!

1145
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,910
格鲁
Gru!!

1146
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:55,090
抱歉
Sorry.

1147
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:57,870
看来你得留着手划水呢
Guess you, kinda need your arms to tread water, huh?

1148
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,890
他们还会回来的
They'll be back.

1149
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:12,750
147次约会后
147 dates later...

1150
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:22,200
我能说"好恶心"吗
Can I be the first to say, eww!

1151
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:42,890
好了
Okay.

1152
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,370
不好意思
Excuse me!

1153
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:48,930
不好意思
Hi, excuse me.

1154
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:00,180
各位好
Hi, everybody.

1155
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,350
我有话要说
I'd like to make some toast....

1156
01:29:05,230 --> 01:29:06,330
来吧
Okay.

1157
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:08,950
她...
She... umm...

1158
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:10,860
她亲吻我的伤口
She kisses my boo-boos

1159
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,070
她为我束起发辫
She braids my hair

1160
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,940
我们爱你  亲爱的妈妈
We Love You Mothers Everywhere

1161
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:20,150
我的新妈妈露西无人能比
And my new Mom Lucy is beyond compare

1162
01:29:29,660 --> 01:29:31,660
为新娘和格鲁举杯
To bride! And Gru!

1163
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,980
我好高兴
I'm so happy!
